### Included Content

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SKILL.md` | Skill instructions and capabilities |
| `examples/` | Reference schemas for common patterns |
| `validation/` | Error codes and validation rules |
| `patterns/` | UI pattern reference |
| `traits/` | Standard trait library reference |

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - More detail = better schemas
2. **Describe workflows** - "Users can submit → approve → publish"
3. **Mention roles** - "Admins can delete, users can only view"
4. **Specify persistence** - "Tasks are stored, game state is runtime"
