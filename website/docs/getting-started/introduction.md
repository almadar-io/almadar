# Introduction to Almadar

> **The Physics of Software**: Natural Language → Schema → Production Application

## What is Almadar?

Almadar (المدار) is a **declarative programming language** for building full-stack applications. Instead of writing imperative code scattered across frontend and backend, you declare your application as a schema of:

- **Entities** - Your data structures with persistence rules
- **Traits** - Behavior defined as state machines
- **Pages** - Routes with UI bindings

The Almadar compiler transforms this schema into a complete, production-ready application.

## The Problem Almadar Solves

### Traditional Development

```
Frontend Team          Backend Team          Database Team
     |                      |                      |
     v                      v                      v
  React Code    +     Express API    +      Schema/SQL
     |                      |                      |
     v                      v                      v
 Permissions   +    Permissions     +    Constraints
     |                      |                      |
     v                      v                      v
  Testing      +      Testing       +      Testing
```

**Issues:**
- Business logic duplicated across layers
- Permissions scattered in middleware, routes, and queries
- Documentation separate from code
- Testing requires multiple approaches

### Almadar Development

```
Almadar Schema (.orb file)
        |
        v
   almadar compile
        |
        v
Full-Stack Application
  - React Frontend
  - Express Backend  
  - Database Models
  - Permissions
  - Documentation
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- Permissions in guards (one place)
- Schema IS documentation
- State machines are inherently testable

## Key Concepts

### 1. Entities

Entities define what your application manages:

```json
{
  "name": "Task",
  "persistence": "persistent",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "title", "type": "string", "required": true },
    { "name": "status", "type": "enum", "values": ["pending", "in_progress", "done"] },
    { "name": "assignee", "type": "relation", "target": "User" },
    { "name": "dueDate", "type": "date" }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Traits

Traits define how your application behaves using state machines:

```json
{
  "name": "TaskLifecycle",
  "stateMachine": {
    "states": [
      { "name": "Pending", "isInitial": true },
      { "name": "InProgress" },
      { "name": "Done" }
    ],
    "events": [
      { "key": "START", "name": "Start Working" },
      { "key": "COMPLETE", "name": "Mark Complete" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. The Closed Circuit

Every user action follows this path:

```
1. Event    → User clicks "Complete Task"
2. Guard    → Check: Is user the assignee?
3. Transition → State: InProgress → Done
4. Effects  → Server: Save to DB
             → Client: Show toast, refresh list
5. Response → UI updates with real data
```

## Why "Almadar"?

Almadar (المدار) means "orbit" in Arabic. Just as planets follow predictable paths governed by physical laws, applications built with Almadar follow predictable paths governed by state machines.
