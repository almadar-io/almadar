# Almadar

> **The Physics of Software**: Declare your application, compile to production

Welcome to the Almadar programming language documentation. Almadar is a declarative approach to building full-stack applications through state machines, entities, and traits.

## The Almadar Philosophy

### The Closed Circuit Pattern

Every user interaction in Almadar follows a guaranteed flow:

```
Event (User Action)
    ↓
Guard Evaluation (Permission Check)
    ↓
State Transition (Behavior Logic)
    ↓
Effects Execution
    ↓
Response to UI
```

This pattern ensures:
- **Security by design** - Guards enforce permissions at the transition level
- **Predictable behavior** - State machines can only exist in valid states
- **Testability** - Every path is enumerable and testable

### Three Pillars

1. **Entities** - What your application manages (data)
2. **Traits** - How your application behaves (state machines)
3. **Pages** - Where your application appears (routes)

### Why "Almadar"?

"المدار" (Almadar) means "The Orbit" in Arabic. Like planets in orbit around a star, application components in Almadar follow predictable, law-governed paths. The laws of physics ensure stability; Almadar's state machines ensure application consistency.
